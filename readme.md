A project based on markdown where you can write screenplays and such on this language to be rendered later.
Write your plays anywhere, on any text editor, then bring it here.

\## Description of actions, for example.

\# Actor name

This is a character speaking.

---

#### TODOS - A lot.

TODO - scroll should follow caret

TODO - title page should have a multiplication or something on the scroll

TODO - type should render the pages differently

TODO - count pages (it should be more or less 55 lines per page on a screenplay)

TODO - CONTINUE mark when it needs to (again, for that I'll need to count the pages, also I'll need to see if the renderer is wrapping or not, maybe?)

TODO - parenthesis should be centered.

##### TODO - autocompletion, here's what I've thought:

<s>\###ed a place = EXT - A PLACE - DAY</s>

<s>\###in a place = INT - A PLACE - NIGHT</s>

<s>\#1 = Actor by appearence, example:</s>

<s>\# Joe</s>

<s>\# Maria</s>

<s>\#1 = Joe</s>

<s>\#2 = Maria</s>

#### DONES

DONE - Autocompletion for places (couldn't set time of day yet, though)

DONE - Autocompletion for actors by numbering their appearence.
