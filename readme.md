# Clapperdown 
A project based on markdown where you can write screenplays and such on this language to be rendered later.
Write your plays anywhere, on any text editor, then bring it here.

### Actual writing

\### EXT. PLACE - DAY

\## Description of actions, for example.

\# Actor name

This is a character speaking.

---

#### TODOS - A lot.

TODO - scroll should follow caret

TODO - title page should have a multiplication or something on the scroll

TODO - type should render the pages differently

TODO - count pages (it should be more or less 55 lines per page on a screenplay)

TODO - CONTINUE mark when it needs to (again, for that I'll need to count the pages, also I'll need to see if the renderer is wrapping or not, maybe?)

TODO - parenthesis should be centered.

##### TODO - autocompletion, here's what I've thought:

\###ed a place = EXT - A PLACE - DAY

\###in a place = INT - A PLACE - NIGHT

\#1 = Actor by appearence, example:

\# Joe

\# Maria

\#1 = Joe

\#2 = Maria
