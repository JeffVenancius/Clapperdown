# Clapperdown 
A project based on markdown where you can write screenplays and such on this language to be rendered later.
Write your plays anywhere, on any text editor, then bring it here.

#### TODOS - A lot.

TODO - scroll should follow caret

TODO - title page should have a multiplication or something on the scroll

TODO - type should render the pages differently

TODO - count pages (it should be more or less 55 lines per page on a screenplay)

TODO - CONTINUE mark when it needs to (again, for that I'll need to count the pages, also I'll need to see if the renderer is wrapping or not, maybe?)

---

Pretty simple, basically.
